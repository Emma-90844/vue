NOTE:That anything with a v- is aVIEW DIRECTIVE.

Directives are special attributes with a v-prefix.
A diective job is to reactively apply side effects 
to the DOM when the value of its expression changes


<input type="text" v-model="message">
What this means is , In what ever tag you place the 
v- in means bind it in the variable passed in.



 <div v-else-if="count === 1">
    Green Wich  
</div>

 <div v-else="count ===1">
    Orange
</div>





ANATHER DIRECTIVE:  V-SHOW

<div id="root">
    <div v-show="count === 1">
        green
    </div>
</div>


    V-MODEL:
What v model does is creating a two way data binding between the 
user input and vuejs component.

v model craetes a two way data binding between the user input and
 vue component
